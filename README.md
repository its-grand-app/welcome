## 🔐 Security by Design

Your wallet. Your keys. Your rules.  

Grand never exposes your private keys or seed phrases.  
Authentication and encryption use **passkey-based WebAuthn**, ensuring your assets remain safe even across devices.  

Every transaction, every reward, every byte **on-chain and verifiable**.
